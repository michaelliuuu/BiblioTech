#### Description:
This application is a library management system for tracking books, patrons, and transactions. Librarians can
add and remove books, manage patron information, and track checkouts and returns. Patrons can search for books,
check availability, and borrow/return books.
###
#### Who is this for?
This would be used by Librarians or Library Administrators who need to manage and maintain the library's single
or multiple collection.
###
#### Why did I make this?
I have recently started reading again when I purchased a Kindle, and while I enjoyed having all the books I needed
in one device, I realized that physical books are definitely superior. I created this application to learn how to develop
a management system and with my love for books, I decided to make it with a theme of a library.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would have been able to improve coupling within my code by identifying methods that I reuse often and putting them into
interface/abstract classes. For example, I have several toString() methods that I could have pulled out into an abstract or interface class
which would allow me to easily change the text in one place if needed, instead of going to each class and changing them.

Regarding my GUI class, I would have loved to put more time into putting unnecessary fields in certain methods and putting them in
their own methods, to reduce the bulk of the method itself. This would allow me to easily find which method needs to be changed or not, instead of
lumping several functions within a method.
